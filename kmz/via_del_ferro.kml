<b></b>Per secoli l'estrazione del ferro fu quell'attività che, maggiormente, influì sullo sviluppo economico dell'Alta Valle Brembana, ben più di quanto poteva dare l'attività agro-silvo-pastorale. Le miniere, da cui si estraeva ferro, hanno origini antiche. A partire dal 1100, per alcuni secoli le attività minerarie vennero gestite da consortie di famiglie locali, più tardi si imposero con notevoli contrasti, fra le altre potenti famiglie, i Torrioni provenienti dalla vicina Valsassina. I territori delle Valli di Averara, Valmora e Valtorta, infatti, furono per secoli compresi nella contea della Valsassina. L'attività mineraria portò allo sviluppo di importanti traffici intervallivi con la Valsassina e i vicini Grigioni, dove venivano esportate lame, chiodi, attrezzi agricoli.  <br><br>
